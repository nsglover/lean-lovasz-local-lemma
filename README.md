# lean-lovasz-local-lemma
This repository contains a formal proof of the Lov√°sz Local Lemma (and the symmetric corollary) in Lean 3.0. It was originally written as the midterm and final project of the Fall 2022 iteration of the Interactive Theorem Proving course (number 21-321) at Carnegie Mellon University, taught by Professor Jeremy Avigad.

I will eventually translate this proof to Lean 4.0.
